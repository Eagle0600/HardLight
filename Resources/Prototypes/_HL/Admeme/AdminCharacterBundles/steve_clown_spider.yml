# Steve is a space faring modified bug (not technically a spider) - they deal no damage but rather inject small amounts of omnizine
# however their bites also deal stamina damage, meaning theyre not the best front line healer
# they can survive and move in space, and have a passive healing equal to omnizine
# they were also given increased health - to help make them more durable, and to survive fire from ignorant scared crewmembers
# theyre designed not to be an atagonist, but rather a crew aligned companion

      content: "Steve the friendly clown-spider hails from the vibrant, jungle-covered planet of Zyphora, known for its diverse and peculiar fauna. Created by Dr. Nirou-Jol in ColComm's Xenobiology laboratories, he was designed as a cheerful mascot for the Steve Co brand, embodying a playful yet helpful spirit of service. Despite his small, canine-sized frame and clownish appearance—complete with bright colors and a tiny red nose—Steve is a biological marvel, delivered in a sturdy wooden box to various space stations. His communication is often telepathic due to his limited speech, but he's known for injecting small doses of omnizine via his bites, which slowly heals wounds, alongside dealing significant stamina damage to foes. As a science project and mascot, Steve combines his healing abilities with a playful, protective nature, making him a beloved yet formidable presence in his universe."
